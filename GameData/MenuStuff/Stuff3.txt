The aim of the game is to collect all the melons in a level, and then get to the red exit portal - to progress to the next level. Watch out though, there are a few risks!

1) Time, the yellow bar down the left of the screen is the time, if it gets to zero you will lose a life and respawn

2) enemy toast, these toasts cannot be killed, and if you touch them you will die and respawn at the start again

3) The edge, fall off the level and you will die and respawn
