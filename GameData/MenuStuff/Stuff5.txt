You are a slice of ninja toast.

Your god-like speed, dexterity, jumping power and reflexes are 
the result of real butter. Sadly, your natural lifetime is only 15 
minutes.

Like all ninja toast you must quest for immortality, by collecting 
slices of melon.

You are guided thus by a devout belief in T.

T, "The way of the true butter brotherhood" is an ancient and 
advnced art of physical and spiritual training. T emphasises 
pacifism, melons, and the need to traverse increasingly 
complicated rooms guarded by lethal toast killing guards.
