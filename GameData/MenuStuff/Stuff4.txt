Ok, lets see what I can do to give you a few tips...

1) Go slowly, if you try to rush to the end of the level you're sure to die by falling off or hitting a toast or something. You do get a bonus for doing the level quickly but no bonus is worth losing a life for!

2) Wall jumping, this is your best ninja skill! If you jump onto the side of a wall and push towards the wall you'll fall really slowly as you grab onto the wall. Now, if you jump you'll jump up the wall a bit - keep doing this and you can walk up a vertical wall!

3) The enemies are really predicatable, so if you're faced with a horribly complex level take a second or two to watch the enemies and see how you can avoid them - plaaning always succeeds better than just jumping and hoping :)
